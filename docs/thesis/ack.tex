Thank you to my parents, for encouraging me to pursue my education, and putting up with the huge piles of messed-about-with hardware that follows me around. 

James, Dalton, for coding. 

Jon for vastly speeding up the virtual laser

Dr. Jay McCarthy for the useful pointers in linguistics and \todo{put this better} and keeping me on track when I was getting into the weeds of Turing completeness. 

Thank you to Dr. Radhika Nagpal for the loan of the E-Pucks, taking the time to be on my committee, and an impressive body of works in swarm robotics that inspired and informed some of this work. 

Thank you to Dr. Holly Yanco, for encouraging me to turn one of my side projects into a thesis. For keeping the buracracy at bay so we can work, for the encouragement and occasional splash of cold water to keep us focused on real robots doing real things. And finally for the encouragement to get out. I've loved working here, but I guess it's time to go.   \todo{make not a notes section}

Thank you to Vanessa Evers, Edwin Dertien, and the staff of the Human Media Interaction group at the University of Twente for hosting me while I worked on the swarm hardware. It was engaging and inspiring to ``do things with stuff'' with you.
