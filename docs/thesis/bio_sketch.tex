\section{Biographical Sketch}
Abraham Shultz received his bachelor's degree in computer science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 2004.
After graduation, he spent 5 years in industry as a software developer, working for Radiospire, RSA, and EMC$^2$.
He joined the Robotics Laboratory at UMass Lowell in 2010. 
Abraham received his master's degree in computer science from UMass Lowell in 2016 for work on simulating mouse cortical cultures and integration of cortical cultures with a robot arm and camera to build a cybernetic system. 
The work described in this thesis is an outgrowth of a personal project to make swarm robotics affordable for home experimenters, a topic of which he is still fond.
