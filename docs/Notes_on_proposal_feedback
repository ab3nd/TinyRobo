Hobby robotics is very underrepresented in the scientific literature, searches on google scholar didn't turn up much about the platforms used
	- Could try screen-scraping instructables or something
	- Seems like more trouble/time than it's worth

Why use real robots?

Brooks in Artifical Life and Real Robots: "unfortunately there is a vast difference (which is not appreciated by people who have not used real robots) between simulated robots and physical robots and their dynamics of interaction with the environment"
	- Is this still the case? This was in the '90s
	- This paper is REALLY precient
		- evolvable controllers for real robots
		- Golem project evolving bodies/controllers together
	"Without regular validation on real robots, there is a great danger that much effort will go into solving problems that simply do not come up in the real world with a physical robot"
	"There is a real danger (in fact, a near certainty) that programs which work well on simulated robots will completely fail on real robots because of the differences in real world sensing and actuation - it is very hard to simulate the actual dynamics of the real world."

	Sensors are uncertain
		It seems like I have virtual sensors, and so I'm way more certain. 
		This is not the case, I have physical sensors, they're just not the physical sensors that they are presented as. 
		Sonar is not a ruler, but we use it to measure distance. 
		A camera is not a laser, but it's still a physical optical sensor being used to measure distance
			Could test noise of camera based fake laser vs real lasers, characterize difference between multiple sensor readings of same thing

	Nap of carpet can affect odometry
		- which some people tried to work around with nap sensors
			- which is clearly insane, but has kind of a chicken-and-egg feel to it
		- this isn't the kind of thing simulators even attempt to do
			- combinatorical disaster (how many kinds of carpet are there?)

Tim Smithers, "On Why Better Robots Make it Harder"
	The idea that the variation in real robot behavior will go away if the robots are "better" as a justification for simulation
	Better-made components allowing hunting where worse ones provided damping (steam engine governor example)
	Don't view robots as measuring with sensors and reasoning about results
		Sensors act as filters whose output drives internal robot dynamics

Simulation Tools for Model-Based Robotics: Comparison of Bullet, Havok, MuJoCo, ODE and PhysX
Tom Erez, Yuval Tassa and Emanuel Todorov.
	Most simulators aimed at visual plausibility, for video games
	Contact dynamics are particularly hard (NP-Hard, in fact)
		workaround is approximation, which raises concerns about accuracy
	Simulations deviate due to
		numerical instability
		model errors
			e.g. Sims and the evolved robots that push themselves around
	Showed speed accuracy tradeoff, no simulator stood out over all others
	ODE does coriolis forces, which is how Sims bots cheated 
	PhysX and Havoc don't, so that's still possible

	So overall, yes, the situation Brooks described still holds

An Overview about Simulation and Emulation in Robotics
Michael Reckhaus, Nico Hochgeschwender, Jan Paulus, Azamat Shakhimardanov and Gerhard K. Kraetzschmar
	Simulation went out of fashion when people started getting real robots
	Computers got better and games drive for realism pushed development
	Proposes a lot of use cases and reasons to use simulation
		Which are interestingly orthogonal to the reasons not to use it
			One doesn't counter the other, it's just "here are the good parts, here are the bad parts"

Swarm Engineering
S. Kazadi PhD Thesis from Caltech, May 2000


Defence of heterogeneity
	Keeps individual robots from becoming complex by attempting to do everything
		Spreads ability over swarm, if there are multiple gripper robots and multiple scout robots, losing one isn't as problematic
		Swarmanoid
	Practical concern with toys
		May build swarm in stages, change platforms based on ability or cost
		Tries to move platform-specific calculations closer to the hardware, leaving higher-level concerns able to be interchanged
	Impact on compilation
		minimization of mobility heterogeneity means that current translator does not use robot capability in translation
		Could be extended to ensure that tasks were assigned to robots that can perform them
			Task assignment is a well-studied problem in the literature
			Makes the assumption that the robots the user selects have the capability to do what they command
				Error back to user if robot can't do it? Select closest robot that can?
	Heterogeniety is a good model of real-world situations
		Swarm members of different capability, e.g. family groups of pack animals, young-old, ill members
		Military convoy with different vehicles (HUMV, Tank, Jeep)
		Human/robot teams 


A Minimalist Flocking Algorithm for Swarm Robots
Christoph Moeslinger, Thomas Schmickl, and Karl Crailsheim
	Simulated flocking 
	Can work with heterogeneous robots as long as they use the same sensing method (IR rangers)
		Doesn't actually justify how they know this, though
		Robots heading/motion is abstract, so could be mobility-heterogeneous

Self-Organized Flocking with a Heterogeneous Mobile Robot Swarm
Alessandro Stranieri, Vito Trianni, Eliseo Ferrante, Carlo Pinciroli, Marco Dorigo, Ali Emre Turgut, Mauro Birattari
	Heterogeneous
	Aligning robots can agree on a common heading
	non-aligning robots cannot
	Behavioral heterogeneity
	Boids - seperate, cohere, align
		This work, some robots don't align
	As proportion of aligning robots drops, performance degrades

Mixed Species Flocking for Heterogeneous Robotic Swarms
Sifat Momen, Bala P. Amavasai, Nazmul H. Siddique 
	Defines flocking efficiency as percentage mean number of agents participating in a flock
	Two types of agents, can tell each other apart
	Variable heterospecific attraction (tendency to join each other's flocks)
		Increasing this increases efficency
	Doesn't really indicate why heterogeneity is cool
		Birds apparently form mixed flocks for predator defence

Flocking for Heterogeneous Robot Swarms: A Military Convoy Scenario
Christopher JR. McCook and Joel M. Esposito
	2 unit types, supply unit and defender unit
	Control based on potential field derived from stated goals of the units

(37 authors, but it was a big project...)
	Accuses swarm systems of being homogeneous as an oversimpification of natural systems, e.g. all worker ants
	Footbots (wheeled, with omnicams)
	Handbots (climbers and manipulators)
	Eyebots (flyers, with cameras for overhead views)
	No centralized control
	Swarm + Humanoid, intended to refute the idea humans are the best form to operate in human-designed spaces
	Interchangalbe parts, gives robustness
	Local ad-hoc groups and structures to perform tasks
	Being able to physically interact adds complexity to design
		Manipulation and sensing methods must be compatible to allow interaction and communication
		Robots may have very different perceptions and want to communicate about them
	Indirect relationship between what individual robot is doing and what swarm as a whole is doing
		Heterogenieity increases complexity
	All the robots do IR comms and range/bearing sensing
	Eyebots collaborate to localize off each other
		Other robots can also localize off of them

Does driving real robots affect user behavior?
	Does realism of NUI affect user behavior?

How/when do humans stop treating people as individuals and start dealing with groups?
	Gestalt perception 
		Proximity principle, elements near each other are perceived as groups
		Common fate principle, things that move together are perceived as a unit
		Similarity principle, elements that are the same are grouped together
		Various others
			But the heirarchy among them is amorphous, so doesn't give clear parsings of complex scenes

Do Numbers Really Count? Group Threat Theory Revisited
Dr Mikael Hjerm
	Size of a minority affects perception of threat to the majority
	Actual and perceived size of minority doesn't affect threat perception across 20 EU countries
	Not really about group size for social interaction

Perception of Groups, Size of Opposition, and Social Influence
DAVID A. WILDER
	Organized attempted social influencers as group, multiple small groups, or individuals
	More groups -> more conformity
	Varying size of single group -> little effect on conformity
	Increase in opposition size beyond 3-4 people has little impact
		First opposer is a leader, the rest are clearly sniviling synchophants
		So the group more-or-less counts as 1 person
	"Persons may regard opponents as discrete individuals contributing independent bits of information until opposition size increases beyond some critical point, after which they are perceived as a single group unit. Additional opponents are assimilated to the group unit, so that the number of distinct entities in opposition remains constant. This process is analogous to a Gestalt principle of organization in which elements exhibiting similar characteristics are “grouped” together."
	4 individuals is 4 data points, but one group of four people is one data point
	Similar actions in a group is assumed to be a product of group influences
	Similar actions in individuals are assumed to be product of their internal state/abilities
	Talks about a cut-off group size, but doesn't say what it is

Choice Behavior in Social Dilemmas: Effects of Social Identity, Group Size, and Decision Framing
Roderick M. Kramer, Marilynn B. Brewer
	Larger groups get worse at providing a public good
		Probably diffusion of responsibility, there are enough people doing X that I don't have to
		Number of other possibilities (social loafing, decrease in payoff, deindividualization)
	Mixed findings around group size, one reports showed no difference between 7 and 20, but another found 1 was better than 3 was better than 6
	Not really related, has to do with perception of group one is in

Perceiving Persons as a Group: Effects on Attributions of Causality and Beliefs
DAVID A. WILDER
	Distinction between groups and aggregates of people
	Groups have a boundary, in or out, aggregate does not (just a random set of people, anyone could be in it)
	Not about how people make the distinction between individuals and groups, but how they perceive the people in either aggregates or groups

Trust Transfer on the World Wide Web
Katherine J. Stewart
	Cites Campbell (1958) for introducing "the term 'entitativity' to describe the degree to which a collection of individuals is perceived as a group"
		Continuum, not binary group/not group distinction
		Higher entitativity -> higher expectation of unity and consistency
	Members of small groups perceived as more similar than members of large groups (salience increases as group size decreases)

Elements of a Lay Theory of Groups: Types of Groups, Relational Styles, and the Perception of Group Entitativity
Brian Lickel and David L. Hamilton, Steven J. Sherman
	What is people's intuitive understanding/taxonomy of groups?
		Clustering of survey categorization of groups
			Intimacy groups (friends, family, romantic)
			Task groups (work, jury)
			Social category (gender, race, class)
			Loose associations (line at the bank, parade crowd, fans of a musical genre)
		Clusters have different qualities wrt permiability, size, duration, level of interaction, etc. 
	How do they arrive at conclusions about groups?
	Perception of relationsl style in the group and perception of entitativity are related
		unclear how degree vs quality of interaction affects perception of entitativity


Varieties of Groups and the Perception of Group Entitativity
Brian Lickel and David L. Hamilton, Grazyna Wieczorkowska, Amy Lewis and Steven J. Sherman, A. Neville Uhles
	Cited from previous paper "Elements of a Lay Theory..."
	Curse of high dimensionality
		What a "group" is is highly variable
	Very little study of dynamic small groups (more study of stereotypes of large groups not personally related to the subject)
		Relational vs. perception, are subjects within group, or outside observing?
	Entitativity is about perception of group, not actual objective assessment of the group
		How much do they appear to be a group, not how well do they actually function as one
		Affects perception as causal agent, higher entitiativity -> more causally effective
	Perciever differences
		Need for closure (?)
		individualism/collectivism biases in observer
	Contextual factors
		Observer in group or not
		competition present between groups?
	Properties of the group itself
		do they all dress the same?
		Similarity in Campbell paper, possibly links to gestalt perception
	Minorities higher in entitativity
		Arguably links to gestalt perception, figures vs. ground
		members stereotyped -> increased similarity within group -> higher entitativity
	Entitativity isn't about the group size cutoff so much as it is about the groupiness of a group. 

Static Versus Dynamic Theories and the Perception of Groups: Different Routes to Different Destinations
Sheri R. Levy, Jason E. Plaks, Ying-yi Hong, Chi-yue Chiu, Carol S. Dweck
	Static view thinks people are fixed entities
	Dynamic view thinks people are changeable tendencies
	Has effects on perception of groups, but not related to my work

Neocortex Size as a Constraint on Group Size in Primates
R. I. M. Dunbar
	Group size is a function of neocortical size, but environment is not 
	Information overload is on whole network structure, not count of dyadic relationships
	Larger groups are groups of grooming cliques
		Implies formation of heirarchy at ~150 members (upper bound, for humans)
	Selective pressures favoring larger groups drive increased brain size
	Could put an upper bound on human social groups, but that isn't the same thing as perceived group size

A Study of Interaction and Consensus in Different Sized groups
A. Paul Hare
	9 groups of 5 boys and 9 groups of 12 boys (all boy scouts)
	Rated 10 pieces of equipment individually for utility in escaping the wilderness
		Each group then had to select the most important piece
	Measured increase in consensus after discussion
	Smaller groups acheive consensus better
	Leaders have more influence in small groups
	Larger groups take longer to come to consensus

Shad Gross, Jeffrey Bardzell, Shaowen Bardzell
	Interesting points about skueomorphs kept around as kitsch (deliberately) vs kept around because no one thought to do it a different way
	

Overall, it feels like the research in social psychology for how groups are perceived as groups vs. aggregations and how much of an entity the group is are highly dependant on a large number of distinct factors. My robot groups have color, heading, spacing, but beyond that don't display a lot of the variation that people display, even when the group they are in has strong entiativity (also depends on context, the robotics club is an entity, the same people standing in line at a bank would be way less of an entity). Human perception of groups has less to do with exact count of people, and far more to do with common cause, visible similarity, tasks, interpersonal relations, etc. 

Affordances for designing natural user interfaces for 3D modelling
Zoltán Rusák, Ismail Cimen, Imre Horváth and Aadjan van der Helm
	Physical and anthropomorphic aspects of hand gestures
	Discussion of various matching methods
	Have to balance what can be detected by the technology with what the user finds appropriate
	Users asked to do gestures for various modeling actions
		motions, rotations of object
		Selection of object
		motion/rotation of camera/zoom
		extrude
		undo
		etc.
	Validation by doing the tasks
		Qualitative accuracy assessment
	Error types
		1 - hand motion isn't part of the UI, so system doesn't recognize it
		2 - system fails to recognize an action that is part of the UI
		3 - errors due to limitations of the tracking technology
	Mouse and keyboard took less time, but more actions
		It would be nice to know how an "action" is defined...
	Extrusion and delete tasks had most of the errors
		Mostly type 2 & 3, so the gesture chosen by the designer was bad

Semiotic analysis of multi-touch interface design: The MuTable case study
Jan Derboven, Dries De Roeck, Mathijs Verstraete
	Semiotic analysis (meaning of signs and sign systems)
	User interface is a message from designers to users
	early NUI, content serves as the interface
	Users interact in a direct, unmediated way
		In theory, no icons, no metaphors
			But anything on a screen is a metaphor
