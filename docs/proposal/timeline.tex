\chapter{Timeline}

As of this writing, the deadlines for filing Declaration of Intent to Graduate forms for spring completion is unknown, but is likely in the last week of March or first week of April. 
The deadline for submitting a thesis or dissertation is May 3rd of 2018. 
Commencement is May 19th. 

\section{December 2017}

\subsection{Week 1}

Code first 10 users with two coders. A coding program was written to facilitate coding, based on the codes present in the first 10 users. Use of the coding program will ease automation of parts of the data analysis. 
Check Cohen's K on subset of data.
Write codebook for full coding. 

\subsection{Week 2}

Recode full data set using codebook.
Start writing data analysis scripts.

\subsection{Week 3}

Christmas travel. 
Data analysis.

\subsection{Week 4}

Christmas. 
Analysis of results from coding.

\section{January 2018}

\subsection{Week 1}

Write up results of data analysis.
At this point, it should be clear that there either is or is not a transition point where the user changes the gestures they use for a bigger swarm. 
If there is no transition, then it would seem to indicate that the same UI can be used for individual robots and swarms. 

\subsection{Week 2}

Modify state machine to recognize most common gestures, as determined from coding and analysis. 

\subsection{Week 3}

Implement or modify state machine to emit proper GCPR for common commands. 
Connect GCPR and GCPR interpreter, possibly to real robots, possibly to simulated ones. 
 
\subsection{Week 4}

Test full gesture-to-robot compilation path. Components of this chain have already been at least partly developed, including a basic gesture recognizer, a state machine for detecting commands based on gestures, and a GCPR evaluator for ROS.

\section{February 2018}

\subsection{Week 1}

Debug complete system. 

\subsection{Week 2}

Debug system. 
Shoot video of system when operational, or record rosbags. 

\subsection{Week 3}

Debug compiler and robot runner. 
Write up full interface/system, including instructions for other people to operate it. 

\subsection{Week 4}

Merge experiment write-up paper and system documentation with thesis.
Start presentation for defence, based on presentation for proposal. 

\section{March 2018}

Defence should be scheduled for this month. 

\subsection{Week 1}

Writing.

\subsection{Week 2}

Writing.
Submit intention to graduate form. 

\subsection{Week 3}

Writing.

\subsection{Week 4}

Final polish on writing. 
Submit dissertation to Library.
