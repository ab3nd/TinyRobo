\chapter{Timeline}

\section{December 2017}

\subsection{Week 1}

Preliminary results from second coder working on data from user experiment. 
Check Cohen's K on subset of data (first 10 users)
Write codebook for full coding. 

\subsection{Week 2}

Coders code full data set.
Write analysis tools. 

\subsection{Week 3}

Christmas travel. 
Data analysis.

\subsection{Week 4}

Christmas. 
Analysis of results from coding.

\section{January 2018}

\subsection{Week 1}

Write up results of data analysis.

\subsection{Week 2}

Modify state machine to recognize most common gestures. 

\subsection{Week 3}

Implement or modify state machine to emit proper GCPR for common gestures. 
Connect GCPR and GCPR interpreter, possibly to real robots, possibly to simulated ones. 
 
\subsection{Week 4}

Test full gesture-to-running robot compilation path. 

\section{February 2018}

%Gestures - The experiment to collect the gesture data set will be completed, and analysis of the gesture data set will be done. 
%The results will be written up and published if possible. 
%At this point, it should be clear that there either is or is not a transition point where the user changes the gestures they use for a bigger swarm. 
%If there is no transition, then it would seem to indicate that the same UI can be used for individual robots and swarms. 

\subsection{Week 1}

Debug compiler and robot runner. 

\subsection{Week 2}

Debug compiler and robot runner. 

\subsection{Week 3}

Debug compiler and robot runner. 
Write up full interface/system. 

\subsection{Week 4}

Merge experiment write-up paper and system documentation with thesis.
Start presentation for defence, based on presentation for proposal. 

\section{March 2018}

%
%As of this writing, the deadline to submit a Declaration of Intent to Graduate form for the fall is unknown (https://www.uml.edu/Registrar/Calendars/2017-fall-grad.aspx lists it as "TBD"), but it is likely in early December. It should be submitted sometime this month. 
%
%Software - Finishing and cleanup work will be done on gesture compiler. It may be possible to connect the UI from the experiment to the overhead camera for the swarm, resulting in a complete overhead view interface for real robots. 
%
%Writing - Notes on gesture compiler design and development will be added to thesis, and possibly developed towards a paper. Thesis defense presentation will be written.

Defence should be scheduled for this month. 

\subsection{Week 1}

Writing.

\subsection{Week 2}

Writing.
Submit intention to graduate form. 

\subsection{Week 3}

Writing.

\subsection{Week 4}

Final polish on writing. 
Submit dissertation to Library. 

\section{Finishing Up}

As of this writing, the deadlines for filing Declaration of Intent to Graduate forms for spring completion is unknown, but is likely in the last week of March or first week of April. 
The deadline for submitting a thesis or dissertation is May 3rd of 2018. 
Commencement is May 19th.
