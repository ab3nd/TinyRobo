\chapter{Timeline}

\section{September}

Gestures - The experiment to collect the gesture data set will be performed in September.   

Software - A preliminary gesture recognition system will be developed, although it may have to be amended to reflect the gestures collected in the experiment. 
Preliminary versions of the gesture compiler and the infrastructure for running the resulting programs on the robots are written, but they will be refined and extended.

\section{October}

Gestures - The experiment to collect the gesture data set will be completed, and analysis of the gesture data set will be done. 
The results will be written up and published if possible. 
At this point, it should be clear that there either is or is not a transition point where the user changes the gestures they use for a bigger swarm. 
If there is no transition, then it would seem to indicate that the same UI can be used for individual robots and swarms. 

Writing - Assuming data set for gestures is useful for a paper, it will be written up and published. The resulting write up, as well as expansion on experimental methodology will be added to my thesis. 

Software - The gesture recognizer will be extended with the gestures collected from the experiment.
Automation will be put in place to have the pipeline from gestures to program deployment on the robots occur without user intervention. 

\section{November}

As of this writing, the deadline to submit a Declaration of Intent to Graduate form for the fall is unknown (https://www.uml.edu/Registrar/Calendars/2017-fall-grad.aspx lists it as "TBD"), but it is likely in early December. It should be submitted sometime this month. 

Software - Finishing and cleanup work will be done on gesture compiler. It may be possible to connect the UI from the experiment to the overhead camera for the swarm, resulting in a complete overhead view interface for real robots. 

Writing - Notes on gesture compiler design and development will be added to thesis, and possibly developed towards a paper. Thesis defense presentation will be written.

\subsection{December}

Defend Thesis

Print copies of the thesis for submission to the library. 

As of this writing, the deadline to submit the thesis/dissertation to the library is unknown, but it is likely around the last day of fall semester classes, Dec 13th.
