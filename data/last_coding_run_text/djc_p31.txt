drag -x -f 1 -t 170.26 -o "Red Robots, Box A" -d "A straight line from roughly the center of the Robot to Box A"

task 2
drag -x -f 1 -t 194.33 -o "Box A" -d "Participant grazes the screen about Box A"
drag -f 1 -t 195.21 -o "Red Robots" -d "Participant draws a line from Red Robots toward the right up around the wall to Box A"

task 3
drag -x -f 1 -t 254.92 -o "Red Robots" -d "Participant draws a line form the bottom of Red Robots toward the right drawing a flat line paralell with the lower border."
tap -f 1 -t 260.24 -o "Ground" -c 1
memo -d "Participant taps on the ground slightly above the Red Robot cluster. Responds to experimenter 'robots stop where they are.'"

task 4
tap -f 2 -t 480.16 -o "Box A" -c 2
memo -d "Participant answers experimenter that this gesture indicates the area for robots to move. Has not indicated how many robots from the cluster should go to this position."
tap -f 1 -t 522.48 -o "Box A" -c 3
memo -d "Three single finger taps to indicate how many robots to go to this position."
memo -d "Participant is asked (paraphrasing) what if you do not know how many robots are in the cloud. How would you Send rougly the same about of robots to each place i.e. box A and B
drag -f 1 -t 643.41 -o "Ground" -d "Participant drew a zero"
tap -f 1 -t 643.89 -o "Ground"

drag -f 1 -t 772.69 -o "Box A" -d "Participant drew a rough zero in Box A"
memo -d "Participant suggests tying a gesture or value to a set of robots so in this case drawing 10 would be associated with orange robots and drawing 10 in Box A would indicate that Orange robots should go there. Participant does not do the same for Red Robots."

task 6
memo -d "I couldn't quite make out what the participant said. I think the participant was explaining that they would do the same as they did in the previous task (task 5)."

task 7
memo -d "Participant indicates they would do the same as they did in task 5."

task 8
other -x -t 1025.29 -o "N/A" -d "Participant rests their hand slightly on the border of the screen (black part around white). This is not a direct interaction with the UI and is only being recorded for the sake of capturing all screen interactions."

tap -f 1 -t 1450.63 -o "Red Robots" -c 1
memo -d "Participant is apparently drawing SQ to indicate square shape. It appeared they then finished with a tap though they do not indicate what the tap means."

drag -x -f 1 -t 1702.85 -o "Ground" -d "Draws A again"
tap -x -f 1 -t 1703.33 -o "Ground"
memo -d "last two taps seemed like indicators for finishing a gesture. Participant doesn't mention anything about them."

tap -f 1 -t 1703.80 -o "Box A" -c 1
memo -d "Only the last tap was indicated on the touch screen. The one before (time 1703.67) looked quite close though may not have actually touched the screen. I'm not sure."

memo -d "Prior to this gesture (1722.51) and after (1720.73) there was a gesture that looks like it could have been a tap though it didn't appear to register. tap (1722.51) doesn't seem to indicate any action so I marked it as example."
drag -f 1 -t 1725.25 -o "Wooden Crate" -d "Draws a C on the crate indicating what the symbol for the crate would be"
tap -f 1 -t 1726.22 -o "Wooden Crate" -c 1

tap -f 1 -t 1982.39 -o "Ground" -c 1
memo -d "Sounds like participant is saying 'tap the code for patrolling or color of robot' so this tap may be intentional to selecing a ui element that pops up after circling though the tap appears more like gesturing toward the place they just drew so i'm not sure."
tap -x -f 1 -t 1986.76 -o "Ground" -c 1
