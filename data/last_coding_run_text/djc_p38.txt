memo -d "Use of the word approximate is generally reserved for selecting a subset of robots that are clustered together. Unless they are specifically stating a number i'm speculating from their path what robots they intended to select. If it's an entire cluster of robots is being selected I assume that is their intention and will not use approximate and also may not count if there is only one cluster"

task 16
memo -d "Participant nearly touches the screen at 511.94 though the cursors postion did not change so I don't think there was contact. Otherwise I would have coded it as a exercise tap with 1 count. I don't think the gesture was intend as part of his response."
drag -f 1 -t 513.12 -o "Red Robots" -d "Draws a lasso like circle around the robots. After the lasso is closed the user draws along the perimeter of the screen, roughly drawing a square starting on the left side and ending on the lower left."
