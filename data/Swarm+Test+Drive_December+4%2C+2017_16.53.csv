Used an iPad to control. Controls were toggle-able between gyroscopic and touch-based. Gyroscopic is fairly self-explanatory: the further you tilt the screen to one side, the faster the robot rolls in that direction. Touch based controls have two inputs: a power meter and a round portrait of the ball on screen. By tapping on any edge of the portrait, you alter the direction that the robot will roll. The robot is engineered to roll in the same coordinate plane as your screen, which means that the controls do NOT function like a steering wheel, where movement is from the perspective of the Sphero.

Besides these directional controls, there were additional buttons on the side that made the robot ""hop"" or ""turbo boost,"" essentially temporarily overriding the nature of its motion to produce a specific effect.",No,,somewhat_not,2003,
