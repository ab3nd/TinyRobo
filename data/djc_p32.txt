memo -d "Participant mentions (paraphrasing) 'using eye tracking to draw a path for the robot'"
memo -d "Participant makes some verbal commands 'tell it to go around... left straight left right left right' after though i'm unsure if those are intentional commands or not. The participant mentions voice command a few times up to this point."

task 5
tap -x -f 1 -t 393.38 -o "Orange Robot" -c 1 -h

tap -f 1 -t 436.98 -o "Box A" -c 1
memo -d "Participant says tap Area A but proceeds to tap Box B. Then Taps Box A so I think the second tap was meant to be the actual tap for the gesture."
memo -d "Audio may have been slightly ahead of the recording. It seems like user spoke about the next task before the experimenter switched to the next slide. Makes sense with the user saying one thing and doing another, if I keep seeing evidence of this i'll keep it in mind as i'm coding."

memo -d "I can't tell what the last gesture was about, it seems like the audio is offset by about 5 seconds but there didn't seem to be talk about holding on Box A's border so I think this was just an idle action."
