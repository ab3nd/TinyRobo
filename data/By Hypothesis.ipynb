The user will instead use commands that control the bulk of the robots as a cloud or flock, but may leave some robots unused. For example, the user may switch from selecting robots as individuals to shaping and pushing the swarm the way a child might play with a bug, putting their hand down so the bug goes around or avoids it, touching the back of the bug gently to make it scurry forwards, and so forth, or by shaping the group as if sculpting, with pushing and pinching to \"carry\" groups around. \n",

This problem will arise at smaller scales if the swarm robots are themselves quite tiny, and some of the available swarm robots are indeed small. Scaling the representation of the robots up, relative to the map, will make the robot representations overlap unrealistically and obscure the map. Instead, we propose that for certain scales of swarms, it makes sense to represent the swarm as the area covered, rather than the locations of the individual robots. This approach has been used successfully for navigation in three dimensions, by developing a controller that causes the individual UAVs to remain within a bounding prism, and allowing the user to control the shape and location of that prism.\n",
