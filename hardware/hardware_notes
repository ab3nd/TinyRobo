Bugs in v1 hardware:
Don't use 0204 parts. They're annoyingly tiny. 1206 for everything. 
The caps are OK 0805
The footprint for the diode is too big, it's only slightly bigger than 1206. 
The footprint for the switch needs the leg contacts moved in by half their length towards the switch
Via for the heat sink for the motor drivers needs to not be under the ESP8266
Connectorize battery

Needs pull-up to connect CH_PD high, pull-downs on GPIO15 (all times) and GPIO0 (only for programming)
 - GPIO15 is what I was going to use for one of the fault sensing lines

DRV8833 might be a good canidate for next driver, but only has PWM interface.
3A drive if outputs are paralleled, available in a TSSOP16 package. 

IFX9201SGAUMA1 would also be good, but requires higher voltage (e.g. two-cell battery and voltage regulation)
Has SPI interface, 6A(!) drive current, full bridge per chip. 
 
https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/22 Has how to get automatic reset, easier than integrating the limpkin.fr reset circuit.  
Needs a serial adapter that has DTR line, ordered that. 

Assembly pointers:
Get you some fine-point tweezers for great good

Ideological bugs:
Off is not where you think it is on the switch (on is towards the battery)
- Label on the PCB
Surface mount ESP8266 has no idiot lights, add one so I can tell when it is on
Add another light to an unused GPIO for debugging
Any reason I shouldn't have all pull-ups be one value (have some 10k and some 1k)?
